#####About
My path in Frontend Development started 9 months ago,when I created a simple CV page using HTML and CSS. Then I dived into learning JS. I have mastered all the information by myself, used some English education courses, Youtube, articles and documentation. 
Now, I am ready to move on. The best way to improve my knowledge - it's work in the real project with team. 

I am a very motivated person, who knows how to get along with people. I consider punctuality and critical thinking to be my strengths.

  const zeroArray = [ ]
  const newArray = [ ]
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      zeroArray.push(arr[i])
    }
    else {
      newArray.push(arr[i])
    }
